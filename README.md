# Build requirements
This project does not build. The game uses a custom font that I did not include in this repository because I was using the MGCB editor (monogame asset pipeline) and therefore forgot. I do not know what font was supposed to be used but the build fails for this reason.

Nonetheless, here are the build requirements had this not been an issue:
Dotnet 8
Visual Studio
Monogame Extension for Visual Studio.
More details here https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/1_setting_up_your_os_for_development_windows.html?tabs=android

There is a playabale version in bin\Debug\net6.0\Birdle.exe

Due to not being able to build it again there will be no release since I cannot build a release version.
